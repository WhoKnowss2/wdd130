    <h2>Kathy Christensen</h2>
    
    <p>HI! I'm Kathy. Originally from Washington State, I now live in Los Angeles, California. My three adult sons live 
       near me. Years ago, when I was 18, I joined the church after meeting a member at work. Having gospel-centered 
       learning as a critical aspect of obtaining secular knowledge is the perfect setting for me as I pursue my 
       bachelor's degree in professional studies with two certificates in family history. </p> 
    <p>I'm an experienced professional forensic, genetic, and investigative genetic genealogist. While genealogy and 
       family history are my passions and where many of my talents are, I also love listening to music, playing video 
       games, and watching movies. As a foodie, I enjoy many different foods and trying new ones. One of my next 
       adventures involves exploring and experimenting with Arroz Chaufa. </p>
    <p>I love that we have incredible fellow students who enrich our experience at BYUI, and I look forward to getting 
       to know you.</p>
